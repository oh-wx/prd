DAY 1 CONVECTIVE OUTLOOK  
   NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
   0139 PM CST MON FEB 25 2013
   
   VALID 252000Z - 261200Z
   
   ...THERE IS A SLGT RISK OF SVR TSTMS LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT
   ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN GULF COAST REGION...
   
   ...20Z OUTLOOK UPDATE...LWR MS VALLEY/GULF COAST...
   DRYING WITH THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF A PRE-FRONTAL WIND SHIFT IS
   CURRENTLY DIMINISHING CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL ACROSS EASTERN TEXAS.  AT
   THE SAME TIME...MOISTURE RETURN ABOVE A RESIDUAL NEAR SURFACE
   COOL/STABLE LAYER...WHICH CURRENTLY TENDS TO DEEPEN NORTH OF THE
   ARKANSAS/LOUISIANA BORDER...AS WELL AS NORTHEAST OF THE LOWER
   MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...CONTINUES TO CONTRIBUTE TO DESTABILIZATION
   AHEAD THE MID-LEVEL LOW.  THIS HAS BEEN SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT A
   SEVERE HAIL THREAT WITH STORMS ON THE LEADING EDGE OF MID-LEVEL
   COOLING SPREADING EASTWARD INTO THE OZARK PLATEAU...WHERE SLIGHT
   RISK PROBABILITIES HAVE BEEN EXTENDED NORTHWARD.
   
   TO THE SOUTH AND EAST...GENERALLY WEAK TO MODEST LOW-LEVEL FLOW
   FIELDS...AND SLOW BOUNDARY LAYER DESTABILIZATION...ARE CURRENTLY
   LIMITING TORNADIC POTENTIAL WITH STORMS NOW DEVELOPING ACROSS
   LOUISIANA.  HOWEVER...CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY BECOME
   MORE CONDUCIVE TO THE RISK FOR TORNADOES LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND
   EVENING.  IN THE WARM SECTOR OF A DEVELOPING SURFACE
   WAVE...LOW-LEVEL HODOGRAPHS APPEAR LIKELY TO BECOME CLOCKWISE CURVED
   AND QUITE LARGE BY 03-06Z...AS A SOUTHERLY 850 MB JET STRENGTHENS IN
   EXCESS OF 50 KT ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHERN ALABAMA INTO THE FLORIDA
   PANHANDLE AND SOUTHWEST GEORGIA.  THIS PROBABLY WILL OCCUR
   COINCIDENT WITH BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTENING AND
   DESTABILIZATION...ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASING POTENTIAL FOR SUPERCELLS
   WITH TORNADOES.  ONE OR TWO STRONG TORNADOES DOES NOT APPEAR OUT OF
   THE QUESTION LATE THIS EVENING/OVERNIGHT...AND PROBABILITIES HAVE
   BEEN ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS.
   
   ..KERR.. 02/25/2013
   
   .PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1029 AM CST MON FEB 25 2013/
   
   ...SYNOPSIS...
   POTENT W TX UPR LOW WILL CONTINUE ENE ACROSS N TX TODAY BEFORE
   TURNING NE OVER THE ARKLATEX TNGT AND REACHING NE AR EARLY TUE. THE
   SYSTEM SHOULD FURTHER STRENGTHEN AS UPSTREAM JET STREAK DROPS SE
   ACROSS WA/ORE INTO THE GRT BASIN.
   
   SFC LOW ATTENDANT TO TX SYSTEM...NOW NEAR WICHITA
   FALLS/ABILENE...SHOULD FURTHER OCCLUDE AS IT TRACKS E INTO SW AR
   THIS EVE AND THEN NE TO THE MO BOOTHEEL EARLY TUE. FRONTAL ZONE
   TRAILING S FROM THE LOW SHOULD INTENSIFY AS POLAR CONTINENTAL AIR
   OVER THE HIGH PLNS SWEEPS EWD AND REACHES PACIFIC COLD FRONT NOW
   OVER E TX. THE STRENGTHENED BOUNDARY SHOULD ACCELERATE E ACROSS THE
   LWR MS VLY/CNTRL GULF CST STATES OVERNIGHT...REACHING WRN GA/THE ERN
   FL PANHANDLE BY 12Z TUE.
   
   IN THE MEAN TIME...STNRY FRONT NOW EXTENDING W-E ACROSS THE FAR NRN
   GULF/N CNTRL FL SHOULD DRIFT NWD AS A WARM FRONT TODAY AND TNGT AS
   HEIGHT FALLS/STRENGTHENING LWR TROPOSPHERIC SSWLY FLOW OVERSPREAD
   REGION AHEAD OF TX LOW. THE BOUNDARY SHOULD MOVE INLAND OVER PARTS
   OF LA...SRN MS/AL...THE FL PANHANDLE AND PROBABLY SRN GA BETWEEN NOW
   AND 12Z TUE.
   
   BOTH THE COLD FRONT AND THE WARM FRONT WILL SERVE TO FOCUS LOW-LVL
   ASCENT/TSTM DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE PERIOD. SOME OF THE STORMS
   LIKELY WILL BE SVR.
   
   ...FAR E TX/ARKLATEX TO CNTRL/ERN GULF CST REGION THROUGH TUE...
   CURRENT SFC DATA SHOW NRN GULF OF MEXICO FRONT BEGINNING TO EDGE NWD
   AS A WARM FRONT...ESPECIALLY OVER FAR SE TX/SW LA. MARITIME AIR S OF
   THE BOUNDARY IS AMPLY WARM AND MOIST TO SUPPORT SVR STORMS...WITH PW
   AROUND 1.25-1.50 INCHES. COMBINATION OF UPLIFT ALONG THE
   STRENGTHENING E TX COLD FRONT...MODEST SFC HEATING...AND INCREASING
   UPR DIVERGENCE/LARGE SCALE ASCENT AHEAD OF TX UPR LOW SHOULD SUPPORT
   TSTM DEVELOPMENT ALONG/AHEAD OF COLD FRONT OVER FAR E TX AND LA
   LATER TODAY AS EML CAP IS BREACHED.
   
   WHILE LINEAR FORCING OF THE COLD FRONT...AND TEMPORARY BACKING OF
   700 MB FLOW AHEAD OF TX LOW...WILL FAVOR SQLN CONVECTIVE
   MODE...EMBEDDED SUPERCELLS APPEAR LIKELY GIVEN EXPECTED
   STRENGTHENING OF SW TO SSWLY DEEP SHEAR TO AOA 70 KTS. IN
   ADDITION...SOME POTENTIAL ALSO WILL EXIST FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
   MORE DISCRETE STORMS AHEAD OF THE SQLN ALONG REMNANT SECTIONS OF THE
   WARM FRONT...ESPECIALLY OVER LA/SRN MS LATER TODAY INTO TNGT. SVR
   HAIL...DMGG WIND...AND TORNADOES MAY OCCUR WITH ANY OF THIS
   ACTIVITY...ALTHOUGH THE GREATEST TORNADO RISK SHOULD BE NEAR WARM
   FRONT.
   
   FARTHER E...IN STRENGTHENING WSWLY MID LVL FLOW DOWNSTREAM FROM TX
   UPR LOW...SATELLITE AND UPR AIR DATA SUGGEST THE PRESENCE OF A WEAK
   SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCE NOW ENTERING WRN AL. CONTINUED ENE MOTION OF
   THIS FEATURE...IN CONJUNCTION WITH SFC HEATING AND LOW-LVL
   CONVERGENCE ALONG WARM/STNRY FRONT...MAY SUPPORT A SEPARATE AREA OF
   SVR POTENTIAL THIS AFTN FROM ERN PARTS OF THE FL PANHANDLE INTO NERN
   FL AND FAR S GA. WITH AMPLE DEEP SHEAR AND ENHANCED LOW-LVL SHEAR
   NEAR BOUNDARY...A FEW SUPERCELLS WITH A RISK FOR SVR HAIL...LOCALLY
   DMGG WIND...AND ISOLD TORNADOES MAY OCCUR.
   
   LATER TNGT THROUGH EARLY TUE THE SVR THREAT MAY INCREASE FROM FAR
   SRN MS/AL INT PARTS OF GA/NW FL AS ENE PROGRESSION OF THE TX UPR LOW
   ALLOWS MID LVL FLOW TO STRENGTHEN AND VEER ATOP WARM FRONT OVER THE
   CNTRL/ERN GULF CST REGION. CONTINUED OCCLUSION OF THE MAIN SFC LOW
   MAY FOSTER DEVELOPMENT OF A TRIPLE POINT SFC WAVE OVER SRN AL OR THE
   WRN FL PANHANDLE THAT COULD SERVE TO FOCUS LOW-LVL ASCENT/SHEAR AS
   THAT FEATURE MOVES NE INTO GA EARLY TUE. A STRONG TORNADO COULD NOT
   BE RULED OUT INVOF THE LOW OR OVER THE FL PANHANDLE SHOULD
   SURFACE-BASED MARITIME AIR SPREAD INLAND WITH IT.
